<p align="center">Play with your Vue components and see them in action!</p>

## Concept

VueSandbox is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)-based utility that allows you to edit Vue components' props in live, and see render updates in a dedicated viewport.

This way it provides a good way to quickly test your components under development, or use them to efficently present features to other people.
