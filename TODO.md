## Global

- Switch to expressJS server tool for local app (which allows finer/more granular configuration)
- Build an online live-testing tool via GH pages (from direct .vue files uploads, if possible)
- Add a minimum amount of unit tests on critical core features

## lib - VSComplexProp

- Use a better objects'/nested objects' management by directly parsing complex JSON-entered values
  (check the 'VueDevtools' pkg for the wanted behavior)
